# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This project involved taking the HTML and CSS behind an existing websit and improving it in small, incremental changes. My goal was to update the website to use HTML semantic elements whenever possible. These included header, nav, figure, main, aside, section, and footer. Use of these elements helps future developer more easily see the basic layout of a website on first glance, and increases accessibility.

I also fixed all internal links within the page. I added alt attributes to all image tags to ensure accesibility. The large image figure was given a title to ensure accesibility, since an alt attribute was not an option. 

With the more specific html semantic elements introduced into the code, the previous CSS classes were rendered obsolete. I was able to consolidate styling on several classes and apply it to the semantic elements, rather than separate classes, simplifying the CSS code.

This was a helpful project for thinking about using semantic elements whenever possible, and consolidating CSS into more concise attribute selectors, which is made possible by the specific HTML semantics tags. I made sure to git commit each time I had a succesful change, ensuring that the front-end appearance of the site never changed.
